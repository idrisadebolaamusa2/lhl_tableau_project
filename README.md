## Results/Key Findings
I chose option 2. FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015. This is a cleaned table of wildlife strikes from 2000-2015 in the United States. Visit the FAA Wildlife Strike Database which contains records of wildlife strikes reported by airlines, airports, pilots, and other sources. The dataset used is  faa_data_subset.xlsx

- The wildlife species most frequently involved in strikes are Mourning dove (2,002), Gulls (1,792), Barn swallow (1,629), European starling (1,462), and Horned lark (1,223).
- The hotspots for wildlife strikes in the United States are California (3,026), Texas (2,306), Florida (2,239) and New York (2,140). Conversely, Wyoming has the least amount of wildlife strikes (50).
- Wildlife strikes are more prevalent in August (4,209), July (3,875) and September (3,286).
- Wildlife strikes are increasing yearly. We predict an increase in wildlife strike over the next 2 years.
- From the dataset, the year with the highest cost of damages from wildlife strikes is 2009 ($66,649,202). Conversely, the year with the lowest cost of damages from wildlife strikes is 2012 ($7,897,771).



## Challenges 
1. Data Quality and Completeness:
Challenge: Dealing with missing or inconsistent data, requiring strategies like imputation and validation.

2. Spatial and Temporal Variability:
Challenge: Analyzing wildlife strikes across locations and time periods with varying reporting standards and environmental factors.

3. Wildlife Categorization:
Challenge: Accurately categorizing diverse wildlife species in the dataset, suggesting the need for grouping and collaboration with experts.

4. Forecasting Reliability:
Challenge: Predicting future trends in wildlife strikes with uncertainties due to complex environmental and aviation factors.

5. Dashboard Design Complexity:
Challenge: Designing an effective and user-friendly dashboard to meet diverse stakeholder needs and preferences.

## Future Goals

- Explore additional features or external datasets for more comprehensive analysis.
- Refine visualizations and dashboard layout for better user experience.
